\paragraph{Collaboration Rules} 

In all assignments we encourage collaboration and the exchange of ideas on the discussion forums.  However, please refrain from the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Posting code or pseudo-code related to the assignments.
\item Using code which is not your own.
\item Posting or sharing problem solutions.
\end{enumerate}
Discussion of solution quality (i.e. objective value) and algorithm performance (i.e. run time) is allowed and the assignment leader board is designed to encourage such discussions.

\section{Preamble}

This is an open source assignment and will not count toward your final grade in the course.  This assignment looks-and-feels like all of the other assignments in the class, but you may ignore the typical collaboration policy guidelines and share your source code with your classmates.

To foster code sharing on this assignment, we provide a github repository including various solutions to this problem (\texttt{\url{http://www.github.com/discreteoptimization}}), which you are free to use.  We encourage you to fork this repository and share your algorithms for the set cover problem.

\section{Problem Statement}

In this assignment you will design an algorithm to solve the {\em Set Cover Problem}.
You are given a number of regions and need to decide where to place a set of fire-stations 
to assure that every region is covered in case of emergency.  
For each possible fire-station, we know the building costs, and the set of regions it covers.
The goal is to select those fire-stations that cover all regions with minimal building 
costs. Figure~\ref{fig:graph} illustrates an example, showing a map of five regions
and the region coverage and costs for four fire-stations, given in different colours.
In the solution, three fire-stations have been selected that cover all regions and 
whose building costs amount to 24.


%Explain the problem in plain english.  Try to tie it into an application, if possible.  Provide an illustration if something comes to mind.  It is even better if the illustrate is of the example provide below.

\section{Assignment}

Write an algorithm to solve the set cover problem. We will now generalise the problem 
and therefore call the regions `{\em items}' and the fire-stations `{\em sets}'. 
The problem is mathematically formulated 
in the following way: We are given a number of items (regions) $N = \{0 \dots n-1\}$ and  
sets (possible fire-stations) $M = \{0 \dots m-1\}$. 
For each set $i \in M$, we know the cost $c_i$, and the set of items $S_i \subseteq N$ that 
it covers. For instance,
in Fig.~\ref{fig:graph}, the first possible fire-station has cost $c_0 = 12$ and covers 
regions $S_0 = \{0,2\}$.
We use variables $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ to denote if we select set $i$. Our goal is to find a
selection of sets with minimal cost that cover all items. 
The set cover problem is formalized as the following optimization problem,

%Introduce the input data, useful sets, and decision variables.  Formalize the problem as a declarative optimization model.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mbox{minimize:} & \displaystyle \sum_{i \in M} c_i x_i \\
\mbox{subject to:} & \\
     & \displaystyle \sum_{i \in M} (j \in S_i)x_i \geq 1 \;\;\; (j \in N)\\
     & x_i \in \{0,1\}\\
\end{array}
$$
%
where the constraint ensures that each item is covered at least once: for each item $j \in N$, 
it states that the sum over all sets $i \in M$ that contain item $j$, has to be greater or 
equal to 1.

\section{Data Format Specification}

The input consists of $|M|+1$ lines, where $|M|$ is the number of sets. 
The first line contains 2 numbers: the number of items, $|N|$, and the number of 
sets, $|M|$. It is followed by $|M|$ lines, where each line represents 
the data for a set $i$: first comes the cost $c_i$, followed by the
items  $S_i = \{ s_{i0}, s_{i1}, \dots \}$ that set $i$ covers.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
|N| |M|
c_0 s_0_0 s_0_1 ...
c_1 s_1_0 s_1_1 ...
c_2 s_2_0 s_2_1 ...
...
c_|M|-1 s_(|M|-1)_0  ...
\end{Verbatim}
%
%
The output has two lines.  The first line contains two values $obj$ and $opt$.  $obj$ is the cost of the selected sets (i.e. the objective value).  $opt$ should be $1$ if your algorithm proved optimality and $0$ otherwise.  The next line is a list of $|M|$ values in $\{0,1\}$, one for each of the $x_i$ variables that represent which sets have been selected.  This line encodes the solution.

%It is essential that the value order in the solution output matches the value order of the input.  Otherwise the grader will misinterpret the output.

\section{Instructions}

\input{instructions.tex}

%We use \texttt{stdout} for output.
%Output to other stream will be ignored (you may want to send runtime information to \texttt{stderr}). Your submission will be tested on a department linux machine. If your algorithm is a standalone program, please name it \texttt{nr},
%otherwise, please specify the compilation procedure,
%it is appreciated if you also provide a script that follows the above format to run the program.

\paragraph{Resources}
You will find several set covering problem instances in the \texttt{data} directory provided with the handout.

%An example output file, \texttt{blabla.out}, is also provided.

\paragraph{Collaboration Rules} 

In open source assignments we encourage collaboration, exchange of ideas, and code!  However, please refrain from the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Posting or sharing problem solutions.
\end{enumerate}
The goal here is to share your algorithms, not just a list of high quality solutions.

%The optimal value for  \texttt{data/gc\_1000\_5} is near $85$.

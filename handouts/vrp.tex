\section{Problem Statement}


In this assignment you will design an algorithm to solve a problem faced by package delivery companies, {\em The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)}.  Every day, a delivery company needs to deliver goods to many different customers.  The deliveries are achieved by dispatching a fleet of vehicles from a centralized storage warehouse.  The goal of this problem is to design a route for each vehicle (similar to traveling salesman tours) so that all of the customers are served by exactly one vehicle and the travel distance of the vehicles is minimized.  Additional problem complexity comes from the fact that the vehicles have a fixed storage capacity and the customers have different demands.  Figure \ref{fig:vrp} illustrates a small VRP and a feasible solution to that problem.  The customers are labeled from $0$ to $4$, with $0$ being the warehouse.  The solution uses two vehicles which are indicated by different colored routes.

\section{Assignment}

Write an algorithm to solve the vehicle routing problem.  The problem is mathematically formulated in the following way:  We are given a list of locations $N = 0 \ldots n-1$.  By convention, location 0 is the warehouse location, where all of the vehicles start and end their routes.  The remaining locations are customers.  Each location is characterized by three values  $\langle d_i,x_i,y_i \rangle \; i \in N$ a demand $d_i$ and a point $x_i,y_i$.  The fleet of vehicles $V = 0 \ldots v-1$ is fixed and each vehicle has a limited capacity $c$.  All of the demands assigned to a vehicle cannot exceed its capacity $c$.  For each vehicle $i \in V$, let $T_i$ be the sequence of customer deliveries made by that vehicle and let ${\it dist}(c_1,c_2)$ be the Euclidean distance between two customers.\footnote{${\it dist}(j,k) = \sqrt{(x_{j} - x_{k})^2 + (y_{j} - y_{k})^2}$}  Then the vehicle routing problem is formalized as the following optimization problem,
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mbox{minimize:} & \displaystyle \sum_{i \in V} \left( dist(0, T_{i,0}) + \sum_{\langle j,k \rangle \in T_{i}} dist(j, k) + dist(T_{i,|T_i|-1}, 0) \right)\\
\mbox{subject to:} & \\
     & \displaystyle \sum_{j \in T_{i}} d_j \leq c \;\;\; (i \in V) \\
     & \displaystyle \sum_{i \in V}  (j \in T_{i}) = 1 \;\;\; (j \in N \setminus 0) 
\end{array}
$$
In this variant of the vehicle routing problem, we assume the vehicles can travel in straight lines between each pair of locations.

\section{Data Format Specification}

The input consists of $|N| + 1$ lines.  The first line contains 3 numbers: The number of customers $|N|$, the number of vehicles $|V|$, and the vehicle capacity $c$.
It is followed by $|N|$ lines, each line represents a location triple $\langle d_i,x_i, y_i \rangle$, with a demand $d_i \in \mathbb{N}$ and a point  $x_i, y_j \in \mathbb{R}$.

|N| |V| c
d_0 x_0 y_0
d_1 x_1 y_1
...
d_|N|-1 x_|N|-1 y_|N|-1
\end{Verbatim}
%
The output has $|V|+1$ lines.  The first line contains two values $obj$ and $opt$.  $obj$ is the length of all of the vehicle routes (i.e. the objective value) as a real number.  $opt$ should be $1$ if your algorithm proved optimality and $0$ otherwise.  The following $|V|$ lines represent the vehicle routes $T$ encoding the solution.  Each vehicle line starts with warehouse identifier $0$ followed by the identifiers of the customers serviced by that vehicle and ends with the warehouse identifier $0$.  Each vehicle line can contain between $2$ and $|N|+2$ values depending on how many customers that vehicle services.  Each customer identifier must appear in one of these vehicle lines.

%It is essential that the value order in the solution output matches the value order of the input.  Otherwise the grader will misinterpret the output.

\paragraph{Warnings} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is recommended you do not modify the \texttt{data} directory.  Modifying the files in the data directory risks
making your assignment submissions incorrect.
\item You cannot rename the \texttt{solver.py} file or the \texttt{solve\_it()} method.
\item Be careful when using global variables in your implementation.  The \texttt{solve\_it()} method will be run repeatedly and it is your job to clear the global data between runs.
\item \texttt{solver.py} must remain in the same directory as \texttt{submit.py}.
\end{enumerate}

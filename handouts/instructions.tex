Edit \texttt{solver.py} and modify the \texttt{solve\_it(input\_data)} function to solve the optimization problem described above.  The function argument, \texttt{input\_data}, contains the problem data in the format described above.  The return value of \texttt{solve\_it} is a solution to the problem in the output format described above.  Your \texttt{solve\_it} implementation can be tested with the command, 
\[ 
\texttt{python ./solver.py ./data/<inputFileName>} 
\] 
You should limit the \texttt{solve\_it} method to terminate within 5 hours, otherwise the submission will not be eligible for full credit.  You may choose to implement your solver directly in python or modify the \texttt{solve\_it} function to call an external application.

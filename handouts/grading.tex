\paragraph{Grading}
Infeasible solutions (i.e. those that do not conform to the output format or violate problem constraints) will receive 0 points.  Feasible solutions will receive at least 3 points.  Feasible solutions passing a low quality bar will receive at least 7 points and solutions meeting a high quality bar will receive all 10 points.  The grading feedback indicates how much your solution must improve to receive a higher grade.
